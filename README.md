An interactive multi-channel image viewer for R.

This shiny application allows users to interactively visualize
multi-channel images and segmentation masks generated by imaging mass
cytometry and other highly multiplexed imaging techniques. The
`cytoviewer` package is divided into image-level (Composite and
Channels) and cell-level visualization (Masks). It allows users 
to overlay individual images with segmentation masks, integrates well 
with [SingleCellExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html)
and [SpatialExperiment](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html)
objects for metadata visualization and supports image downloads.

## Requirements

The `cytoviewer` package requires R version \>= 4.0. It builds on data
objects and functions contained in the
[cytomapper](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytomapper.html)
package.

## Installation

The `cytoviewer` package can be installed from `Bioconductor` via:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")

BiocManager::install("cytoviewer")
```

The development version of `cytoviewer` can be installed from Github
via:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("remotes", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("remotes")

remotes::install_github("BodenmillerGroup/cytoviewer")
```

To load the package in your R session, type the following:

``` r
library(cytoviewer)
```

## Usage

``` r
library(cytoviewer)

# Load example datasets 
library(cytomapper)
data("pancreasImages")
data("pancreasMasks")
data("pancreasSCE")

# Use cytoviewer with images, masks and object
app <- cytoviewer(image = pancreasImages, 
                  mask = pancreasMasks, 
                  object = pancreasSCE, 
                  img_id = "ImageNb", 
                  cell_id = "CellNb")

if (interactive()) {
  
  shiny::runApp(app, launch.browser = TRUE)

  }
```
