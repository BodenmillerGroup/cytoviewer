Package: cytoviewer
Version: 1.1.3
Title: An interactive multi-channel image viewer for R
Description: 
    This R package supports interactive visualization of multi-channel images 
    and segmentation masks generated by imaging mass cytometry and other highly 
    multiplexed imaging techniques using shiny. The cytoviewer interface is 
    divided into image-level (Composite and Channels) and cell-level 
    visualization (Masks). It allows users to overlay individual images with 
    segmentation masks, integrates well with SingleCellExperiment and 
    SpatialExperiment objects for metadata visualization and 
    supports image downloads.
