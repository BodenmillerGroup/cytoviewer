Version: 0.99.0
Title: A interactive multi-channel image viewer for R
Description: 
    This shiny application allows users to interactively visualize multi-channel 
    images and segmentation masks. The cytoviewer package is divided into image-level (Composite and Tiles) 
    and cell-level visualization (Masks). It allows users to overlay individual images 
    with masks and integrates well with SingleCellExperiment/SpatialExperiment objects 
    for metadata visualization.
