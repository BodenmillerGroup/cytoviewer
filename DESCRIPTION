Package: cytoviewer
Version: 0.1.5
Title: A multi-channel image browser for R
Description: 
    This shiny application allows users to interactively visualize multi-channel 
    images and masks. Cytoviewer is divided into image-level (Composite and Tiles) 
    and cell-level visualization (Masks). It allows users to overlay individual images 
    with masks and integrates well with SingleCellExperiment/SpatialExperiment objects 
    for metadata visualization.
